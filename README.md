# Toast

###Ingredients

1 slice of whole wheat bread
a pat of organic butter

Toast the bread to your desired level of toastiness. Take it out of the toaster while it's still nice and hot, and put the butter on it to soften for a minute. Spread the butter out evenly over the toast and enjoy with tea or coffee.
